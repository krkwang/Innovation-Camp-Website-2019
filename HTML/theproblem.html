            <p class="paragraph">In many countries around the world children do not have the opportunity to share their oppinoin about important topics. The children's opinions about the climate changes go unheard even though they are the ones that will live with the consequenses from earlier generations.</p>

            <p class="paragraph">Todayâ€™s children are the grownups of tomorrow. They are the future, yet their voices go unheard. Everyone leaves an environmental footprint. This means that every choice we make has a direct impact on future generations. Environmental actions will be of increasing concern over decades to come, so children should and must be heard! It is our duty to let them think and make up their own minds about this subject.</p>
